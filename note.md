### note:

1. update position is in crowd_sim/envs/utils/agent.py for simulation
2. collision detect is in crowd_sim.py
3. But all we have to change is to implement an policy such that it will give an action based on
trajectory of others


### question:
1. circle crossing v.s. square crossing -- in crowd_sim/crowd_sim.py
2. sim.setAgentPrefVelocity()
